My Scripts for Intune

This is the first script I have created for our Intune environment.

We had a business need to find all mobile devices registered in Intune to users in a particular Azure AD Group for visibilty to the business.

The only input needed is to fill in the Object ID on line 28 and the file location on line 64.

The output will give ou the device name, device type, the OS version and the registered user.

This is my first script :).
